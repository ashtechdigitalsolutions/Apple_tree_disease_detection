Apple Leaf Disease Detection and Recommendation System
The Apple Leaf Disease Detection and Recommendation System is an AI-based solution designed to identify common apple leaf diseases and provide actionable recommendations for treatment and prevention. Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, the system efficiently classifies leaf images into four categories:

Healthy

Cedar Apple Rust

Black Rot

Apple Scab

Key Features
✅ Image-Based Detection: Utilizes deep learning to analyze leaf images and identify diseases with high accuracy.
✅ Comprehensive Report Generation: Provides detailed insights into the detected condition, including recommended treatments, preventive measures, and care tips.
✅ User-Friendly Interface: Designed for ease of use by farmers, researchers, and agricultural professionals.
✅ Fast and Efficient: Delivers results quickly, minimizing the need for manual inspection.

How It Works
Image Upload: Users upload an image of the affected apple leaf.

Disease Detection: The trained CNN model predicts the disease category.

Report Generation: The system generates a report that includes:

Identification of the disease (if present)

Suggested treatments and remedies

Preventive measures to protect surrounding crops

Disease Information and Recommendations
Cedar Apple Rust:

Treatment: Use fungicides containing myclobutanil or propiconazole.

Care: Remove infected leaves and branches to prevent the spread.

Prevention: Avoid planting juniper trees near apple orchards.

Black Rot:

Treatment: Apply copper-based fungicides and prune infected branches.

Care: Ensure proper ventilation in the orchard.

Prevention: Clean pruning tools to reduce cross-contamination.

Apple Scab:

Treatment: Apply sulfur-based fungicides early in the season.

Care: Remove fallen leaves to reduce fungal spores.

Prevention: Grow resistant apple tree varieties when possible.

Healthy:

Recommendation: Continue regular care practices such as watering, pruning, and applying fertilizers.

Technologies Used
Python (with libraries like TensorFlow/Keras and OpenCV)

Google Colab for model training

Kaggle Dataset for training and evaluation

CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) for image classification

Potential Impact
This project aims to help apple growers improve crop health, reduce losses, and promote sustainable farming practices. By automating disease detection, farmers can make informed decisions faster and with greater accuracy.
